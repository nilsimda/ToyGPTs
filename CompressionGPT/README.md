# CompressionGPT
Uses a GPT to compress text via arithmetic coding. Compression is intelligence.

## Arithmetic Coding
The arithmetic coding is inspired by [this](https://marknelson.us/posts/2014/10/19/data-compression-with-arithmetic-coding.html)
Mark Nelson blog post, but written in python.

## TODO
* Decode
* Try more than GPT
* Use NanoGPT instead of HuggingFace Version
